# Financial Trax - A Financial Account Tracker

Financial Trax allows users to keep track of financial accounts, keep track of different fund allocations within each account, and grasp a better understanding of your current financial inventory.

I begun with completing the routes for my user authentication and first resource on the back-end. Once I was able to successfully test these, I moved on to create the functionality to create the users and resources on the front-end. Upon completion, I went through the same process with the second and third resources.

## Setup Steps
  1. Fork and clone this repository
  2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
  3. Use `npm start` to start up server.
